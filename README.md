# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Purpose of this project is to create a Database analysis using SQL techniques.  Pewlett Hackard would like to know the amount of upcoming retiress from the entire company in order to create a plan to prepare for the staffing adjustments.  They are also interested in finding our the amount of indivuals who are eligible to particiate in a mentorship initiative. 

## Results 
- By creating the retirement_titles table, we are able to see all employees who are currently employeed and elegible for retirement.  This datatable also provides us with their length of employment and current job title.

- The unique titles table we created, shows us a more condensed list of information of the eligible retirees.  This list will show us the employees name, number and most recent job title.

- We created a table called "Retiring_titles" which gives us the total amount of employees by job title from the list of retirees. You can see that the mass majority of these listed indivduals have a senior/leadership job title, as shown below.

## Summary

There are a total of 90,398 employees that are upcoming retirement so it is recommended that the company creates a plan to prepare for these changes as soon as possible.  Currently, 1.71% (1549/90398) of the upcoming retirees are eliglbe for mentorship.  With this percentage being fairly low, I would reccommend that the company acts fast with outreach for the mentorship initiative to find out how many of those indivuduals would be interested in the opportunity.  I do not think that we have enough mentors currently to accoomodate for such a large number of new hires that will be needed, so I would suggest looking into other tenured employees that may be eligible to support with mentorship such as other members of senior leadership.
